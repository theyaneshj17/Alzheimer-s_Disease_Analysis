Figure 1: Dynamic functional connectivity analysis across AD subtypes based on corrected ROIID mapping. (A) Effect size distribution from 2278 connections per comparison. (B) Statistical categories: 20, 11, 22 gold standard connections. (C) Network involvement from actual 53 gold standard connections. (D) Top 5 strongest connections with actual effect sizes.
Figure 2: Dynamic network-level connectivity differences. Heatmap based on actual 21 network pair combinations from gold standard connections. Values represent mean absolute effect sizes from corrected analysis.
Figure 3: Network radar plots with static positions and corrected dynamic data. DMN involvement: S1 vs S2 (55%), S1 vs S3 (68.2%), S3 vs S2 (18.2%). SM involvement peaks in S3 vs S2 (45.5%). Static network positions ensure consistent comparison across all radar plots. N = 53 total gold standard connections with corrected ROIID mapping.
